Welcome to my collection of **PowerShell scripts** 🚀  

This repository is where I keep the scripts I write, tweak, and experiment with. Some of them solve small everyday problems, others are automation tools I actually use in real workflows. I built this repo as both a personal toolbox and a place to share with others who might find these scripts useful.

## 💡 Why I Made This
- To automate the boring stuff and save time ⏳  
- To learn and sharpen my PowerShell skills 🔧  
- To have a central hub for scripts I can reuse anywhere 🌍  
- To share snippets, tips, and ready-to-use scripts with anyone interested 🤝

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m **Prabu** 👋  

I believe in **learning by doing**. PowerShell has been my way of automating little things, experimenting with system tweaks, and building reusable tools.  

I enjoy:  
- Writing clean, reusable scripts  
- Simplifying repetitive tasks  
- Documenting my journey so others can learn from it
